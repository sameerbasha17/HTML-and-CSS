# HTML-and-CSS

Hello 😇, In youtube i watched a course on html and css by SuperSimple.dev . LINK : https://youtu.be/G3e-cpL7ofc

I have developed the interface of youtube, still it need some adjustments but i am pretty happy with my youtube clone. I am already familiar with html,css and js too. And i have learnt them in my 2-2 Semester(FSD-I) and 3-1(FSD-II), also i have taken Frontend course in CAT COMPUTER POINT. But i didn't do any projects till now so i thought that i am not enough, But today it's different, this project gave me a confidence in my skill and boost my enthusiasm to develop more projects with high precision and quality. And I will continue this flow ...

It's really a good feeling to learn new topics and apply them through realworld projects... From 2 weeks i have been stick with my laptop to develop this youtube clone 😅. I observed that my brain asking dopamine which is generated while i am coding rather than doing unproductive work.

Here is the deployed link of webpage : https://youtube-clone-sksameerbasha.netlify.app
